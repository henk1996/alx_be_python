# Prompt for a Single Task:

# Ask the user to input a task description and save it into a task variable
# Prompt for the task’s priority (high, medium, low) and save it into a priority variable
# In a time_bound variable, Ask if the task is time-bound (yes or no)
# Process the Task Based on Priority and Time Sensitivity:

# Use a Match Case statement to react differently based on the task’s priority.
# Within the Match Case or after, use an if statement to modify the reminder if the task is time-bound.
# Provide a Customized Reminder:

# Print a reminder about the task that includes its priority level and whether immediate action is required based on time sensitivity.
# A message should be ‘that requires immediate attention today!’
# Example Interaction and Output:

# Enter your task: Finish project report
# Priority (high/medium/low): high
# Is it time-bound? (yes/no): yes

# Reminder: 'Finish project report' is a high priority task that requires immediate attention today!


# Or, for a non-time-bound task:

# Enter your task: Read a book
# Priority (high/medium/low): low
# Is it time-bound? (yes/no): no

# Note: 'Read a book' is a low priority task. Consider completing it when you have free time.
task = input("Enter your task: ")
priority = input("Priority (high/medium/low): ")
time_bound = input("Is it time-bound? (yes/no): ")
